## The Challenge

Students needed reliable remote access to campus resources during off-campus hours. The existing solution was unreliable on campus and difficult to setup and maintain single user accounts for multiple students.

## The Solution

We implemented a robust, Debian-based VNC gateway that provides secure, browser-accessible remote desktop environments. This solution eliminates client-side configuration issues and ensures consistent access.

### Technologies Deployed

*   **OS:** Debian Linux (Headless)
*   **Protocols:** SSH Tunneling, VNC, Reverse Proxy
*   **Security:** UFW Firewall, Fail2Ban, RSA Key Authentication
