Digital infrastructure is the silent backbone of any organization. When it works, *it works*, no problem. However, when it fails, operations **fail** and this causes disruptions. The Hadjie Abdullah Solomon Family Trust required a network architecture that moved beyond basic connectivity to offer garenteed resilience, security, and scalability. Facing the complexities of managing mixed vendor environments and critical server uptime, the goal was clear. Design a system where hardware and software constraints no longer dictated performance. This report outlines the engineering decisions behind deploying a robust designed for 99.9% reliability.
